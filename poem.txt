Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth; 

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim
Because it was grassy and wanted wear,
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day! 
Yet knowing how way leads on to way
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference. 

Robert Frost


He is more than a hero 
he is a god in my eyes-- 
the man who is allowed 
to sit beside you -- he 

who listens intimately 
to the sweet murmur of 
your voice, the enticing 

laughter that makes my own 
heart beat fast. If I meet 
you suddenly, I can' 

speak -- my tongue is broken; 
a thin flame runs under 
my skin; seeing nothing, 

hearing only my own ears 
drumming, I drip with sweat; 
trembling shakes my body 

and I turn paler than 
dry grass. At such times 
death isn't far from me 

Sappho
